    "Analysis and Insights:\n",
    "After each visualization, provide an analysis and the insights you derived from it.\n",
    "General explanation of some common types of visualizations and the insights that can be derived from them.\n",
    "# 1. Bar Chart:\n",
    " A bar chart is used to compare data across different categories. The height of \n",
    "each bar represents the value of a particular variable for each category. For example, a bar \n",
    "chart can be used to compare the number of passengers by class on the Titanic. The insights \n",
    "derived from this visualization can help us understand the distribution of passengers by class \n",
    "and identify any disparities.\n",
    "# 2. Line Chart:\n",
    " A line chart is used to show trends over time. Each point in the line corresponds \n",
    "to a data value at a specific point in time. For example, a line chart can be used to show the number of passengers who survived the Titanic over time. The insights derived from this visualization can help us understand how the number of survivors changed over time and \n",
    "identify any patterns or trends.\n",
    "# 3. Scatter Plot:\n",
    " A scatter plot is used to show the relationship between two variables. Each \n",
    "point in the plot corresponds to a data value for two variables. For example, a scatter plot can be used to show the relationship between age and survival on the Titanic. The insights derived from this visualization can help us understand if there is a correlation between age and survival and identify any outliers.\n",
    "# 4. Histogram:\n",
    " A histogram is used to show the distribution of a single variable. The x-axis \n",
    "represents the range of values for the variable, and the y-axis represents the frequency of each value. For example, a histogram can be used to show the age distribution of passengers on the Titanic. The insights derived from this visualization can help us understand the range of ages \n",
    "of passengers and identify any peaks or gaps in the distribution.\n",
    "# 5. Box Plot:\n",
    " A box plot is used to show the distribution of a single variable and identify outliers. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range of the middle 50% of data values. The line in the middle of the box represents the median, and the whiskers represent the range of the data. For example, a box plot can be used to show the distribution of fares paid by passengers on the Titanic. The insights derived from this visualization can help us understand the range of fares paid by passengers and identify any outliers.\n",
    "# 6. Heatmap:\n",
    " A heatmap is used to show the correlation between two variables. The color of \n",
    "each cell in the heatmap corresponds to the correlation coefficient between the two variables. For example, a heatmap can be used to show the correlation between age and survival on the Titanic. The insights derived from this visualization can help us understand if there is a correlation between age and survival and identify any patterns or trends."
